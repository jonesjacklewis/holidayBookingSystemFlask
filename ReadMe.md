# Holiday Booking System (Flask)

This is a simple holiday booking system written in Python using Flask.

It is composed of two components:

1. `holiday-booking` - this runs the Flask API, and manages the data.
2. `email-interceptor` - this simulates the front end of the system, by modelling a fake email which is parsed.
